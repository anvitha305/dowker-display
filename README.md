# Dowker Display

## Final Objective
Create an RGB LED display to visualize knots with upto 6 [number of crossings tbd] crossings.

## Intermediary Objectives

### Definition of how knots will be represented and constructed from representation
This project will likely rely on the Dowker notation for representing knots [as is implied from the repository name], and it aims to use colored arcs to represent the order by which the knot is drawn to better represent knots than standard knot projections.
